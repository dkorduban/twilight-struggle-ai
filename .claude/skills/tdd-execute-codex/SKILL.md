# TDD-Execute-Codex — Tests First, Smart Routing, Claude Reviews

## Input

The user's message after the trigger is either:
1. A file path to a plan (e.g. `.claude/plan/feature.md`) — read it and extract task description, implementation steps, key files
2. A direct task description — use as-is

Confirm with user before proceeding if key context is missing.

## Model Recommendation

Works with `claude-sonnet-4-6` (default). No model override needed — routing handles complexity automatically.

## Tool Requirements

Advisory checklist — ensure these tools are available:
- `AskUserQuestion` — confirm missing context
- `mcp__codex__codex` and `mcp__codex__codex-reply` — Codex test audit and Route B implementation
- `Task` — dispatch subagents (tdd-guide, code-reviewer, general-purpose)
- `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` — context retrieval
- `Write`, `Edit` — write tests and implement (Route A)
- `Bash` — run tests/lint/git commands

## Core Protocols

- **TDD Mandate**: Tests must be written and verified RED before any implementation begins
- **Code Sovereignty**: Claude is the final authority — review and approve all changes before delivery
- **Stop-Loss**: Do not proceed to next phase until current phase output is validated
- **Language**: Use English when calling tools/models; communicate with user in their language
- **Test Ownership**: Claude owns all test files. Codex never modifies test files.
- **Context Sanitization**: Never pass `.env`, secrets, tokens, API keys, or credentials to any external agent or MCP. Exclude files matching `.env*`, `*secret*`, `*credential*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`. Redact inline secrets before sending.

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 0: Read Plan

1. If argument is a file path, read it and extract: task description, implementation steps, key files
2. If no plan file, use the argument as the task description directly
3. Confirm with user before proceeding if key context is missing

### Phase 1: Context Retrieval

1. Read key files using Read, Glob, Grep (sanitize before passing to agents)
2. Identify existing test framework, patterns, test file conventions, and configuration
3. Establish test baseline:
   - Fast suite (<2 min): run the full suite, record pass/fail counts
   - Slow suite (>2 min) or partially failing: run only tests related to the task scope, record known failures
   - No test suite: skip — note "no baseline available", regression detection relies on new tests only
4. Record `$START_SHA` via `git rev-parse HEAD` for diff scoping
5. If worktree is dirty (uncommitted changes), stop and ask the user to commit or stash their changes before running this skill. Do not proceed with a dirty worktree.

### Phase 2: TDD — Write Tests First (RED)

**Constraint**: This phase outputs test files only. No production code, no interface stubs, no implementation scaffolds. Types/interfaces needed by tests must be defined inline within the test file or use `any`/equivalent.

Read `tdd-specialist-role.md` from this skill directory.

Launch a general-purpose Task agent with:
- Task description
- Sanitized key file contents for context
- Existing test patterns/framework info
- Content of tdd-specialist-role.md as the agent's role context
- Instruction: "Write failing test files ONLY. Do NOT create any production code, interfaces, or stubs. Define any needed types inline within test files. Follow RED phase only."

Apply the returned test files using Write/Edit.

**RED Verification (scoped — run new tests only, not the full suite)**:
- Run ONLY the newly created test files
- Verify they fail for the expected reason ("module not found", "not implemented", assertion failure on missing behavior)
- If tests pass unexpectedly → tests are wrong; revise and re-verify RED
- If tests fail for wrong reasons (syntax errors, broken imports unrelated to missing implementation) → fix the test file, re-run

### Phase 3: Codex Test Audit (max 2 iterations)

**MANDATORY Codex availability check**: `mcp__codex__codex` MUST be listed in the available tools (either in the tool list or in `<available-deferred-tools>`). Do NOT skip or bypass this phase. Do NOT assume Codex is unavailable without checking. If the tool is present, use it — no exceptions. If it is genuinely absent from both locations, note "Codex unavailable — skipping audit" and proceed to Phase 4.

Before implementing, have Codex review the tests for quality, completeness, and edge case coverage.

Run `git add -N .` to mark new test files as intent-to-add.

**Call `mcp__codex__codex`** (iteration 1):
- `developer-instructions`: `"Be concise. Return only the structured verdict format. No prose."`
- `prompt`:

```
Run `git diff $START_SHA` to see newly created test files. Review the tests ONLY (no implementation exists yet).

Evaluate:
1. Do the tests cover the described task requirements comprehensively?
2. Are edge cases covered (null, empty, boundary, error paths)?
3. Are tests well-structured and following project test conventions?
4. Are there any tests that are impossible to implement or fundamentally flawed?

Return ONLY a structured verdict:

VERDICT: APPROVED | WARNING | BLOCKED

CRITICAL: <list or 'none'>
HIGH: <list or 'none'>
MEDIUM: <list or 'none'>
LOW: <list or 'none'>
```

Save the returned `threadId` (separate from the implementation review threadId).

**Parse response**:
- **APPROVED** → proceed to Phase 4
- **WARNING/BLOCKED** → critically evaluate findings before fixing (see below)

**Critical Evaluation of Test Audit Findings**

Before fixing any issues, critically evaluate each CRITICAL/HIGH finding:

1. **Assess correctness**: Is the finding technically accurate? Check the test code and project test conventions.
2. **Check context**: Does the reviewer have full context about the testing strategy and requirements?
3. **Verify applicability**: Does the suggestion improve test quality, or is it a preference / false positive?

**If a finding seems incorrect or questionable:**
- Do NOT fix it or count it as an iteration. Instead, reply to the reviewer with your technical reasoning.
- Call `mcp__codex__codex-reply` (reuse threadId) explaining why the finding appears incorrect, with specific test code references.
- If the reviewer provides additional justification that is convincing, accept the finding.
- If the reviewer concedes or cannot justify further, drop the finding.
- Discussion replies do NOT increment the iteration counter — only fix-and-re-review cycles count.

**If findings are accepted:** Claude fixes all accepted CRITICAL/HIGH issues in the test files, re-verifies RED, then re-calls via `mcp__codex__codex-reply` (max 2 iterations).

After 2 iterations without APPROVED, stop and ask user for direction.

### Phase 4: Route by Change Size

**IMPORTANT**: Routing is based on estimated **implementation** scope only. Exclude test files written in Phase 2 from the size calculation. Evaluate only the production code that needs to be written/modified.

**Small change** — ALL of the following must be true:
- Touches ≤ 2 production files
- Estimated implementation diff ≤ 30 lines
- No new abstractions, modules, or significant logic

**Large change** — any of the following:
- Touches 3+ production files
- Implementation diff > 30 lines
- Introduces new logic, new files, refactoring, or cross-cutting concerns

Announce routing decision (e.g. "Small change — implementing directly" or "Large change — routing to Codex").

---

### Route A: Small Change — Claude Implements (GREEN)

**If the plan has 3+ implementation tasks**, dispatch each task to a subagent (sequentially):
- Before each task: record `$TASK_SHA` via `git rev-parse HEAD`
- For each task: launch a general-purpose Task agent with the task description, relevant test files it must pass, sanitized context files, and instruction: "Implement only this task. Make the provided tests pass. Do not modify test files. Run tests and confirm GREEN before finishing. Report: files changed, test result, any blockers."
- After each subagent: run `git diff $TASK_SHA` (scoped to this task only) to verify changes, run the task's tests to confirm GREEN
- If the subagent reports a blocker: fix directly with Edit/Write or re-dispatch with failure output

**If fewer than 3 tasks**: implement directly with Edit/Write.

After all tasks complete (either path):
1. Run new tests — verify GREEN
2. Run baseline test scope — verify no new regressions
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. If coverage tooling available: check coverage (80%+)
5. Exception — if tests are fundamentally wrong: revise with justification, re-verify RED, re-implement
6. Run `git add -N .` to mark any new untracked files as intent-to-add (ensures `git diff $START_SHA` includes new files)
7. Launch Task agent (subagent_type: "feature-dev:code-reviewer") with:
   - `git diff $START_SHA` output
   - Original task requirements
8. **Critical Evaluation**: Before fixing, critically evaluate each CRITICAL/HIGH finding:
   - **Assess correctness**: Is it technically accurate? Check actual code and project conventions.
   - **Check context**: Does the reviewer have full context, or is it flagging intentional design?
   - **Verify applicability**: Does it improve correctness/security, or is it a style preference / false positive?
   - **If a finding seems incorrect**: Do NOT fix it or count it as an iteration. Launch a new code-reviewer agent with the original diff, the contested findings, and your technical reasoning. Ask it to re-evaluate only the contested items. Accept confirmed findings; drop withdrawn ones. Discussion rounds do NOT count toward the iteration cap.
9. If accepted CRITICAL/HIGH issues remain: fix with Edit/Write, re-review (max 2 rounds)
10. After CRITICAL/HIGH resolved, collect MEDIUM/LOW issues and ask user:
   > "Reviewer flagged N MEDIUM/LOW issue(s) that were not fixed:
   > - [list issues]
   > Should I fix these before delivery, or proceed as-is?"
10. Go to Phase 5

---

### Route B: Large Change — Codex Implements (GREEN, max 3 iterations)

**MANDATORY**: When Route B is selected, you MUST NOT use Edit/Write tools for implementation. All implementation MUST go through `mcp__codex__codex`. Claude's role in Route B is context retrieval, test ownership, verification, and review — not implementation. The ONLY exception is fixing minor regressions found during self-verification (Step B2) that are clearly caused by Codex output (e.g. a missing import, a typo in a generated file).

**No post-routing rationalization**: Once Route B is selected, the routing decision applies to ALL tasks in the plan. Do NOT re-evaluate individual tasks for complexity. If you find yourself thinking "this task is simple enough to do directly" or "this is just a deletion" — STOP. That is the routing decision being second-guessed. The routing already accounted for overall complexity. Every task goes through Codex.

**Codex availability check**: `mcp__codex__codex` MUST be listed in the available tools (either in the tool list or in `<available-deferred-tools>`). If the tool is genuinely absent from both locations (i.e. the MCP server is not configured or not responding), fall back to Route A and announce: "Codex MCP unavailable — falling back to Claude direct implementation." This fallback is ONLY for when `mcp__codex__codex` is technically inaccessible. It MUST NOT be used because a task seems "too simple for Codex" or because Claude judges direct editing would be faster.

**Note on agent spawning**: Codex runs in a sandboxed shell and cannot spawn Claude agents directly. Instead, Claude spawns a subagent per task — each subagent owns its Codex MCP session for that task, keeping both the main context and each Codex session scoped and clean.

Read `codex-architect-role.md` from this skill directory and inject as `developer-instructions` for all Codex calls.

**Step B1 — Dispatch per-task subagents (if plan has 3+ tasks)**

For each implementation task (sequentially — next starts only after current passes tests):

1. Record `$TASK_SHA` via `git rev-parse HEAD` before dispatching
2. Launch a general-purpose Task agent with:
   - The specific task description
   - Relevant test file contents (tests it must pass)
   - Sanitized key file contents
   - The `mcp__codex__codex` and `mcp__codex__codex-reply` tools
   - Instruction:

```
You are implementing one task using Codex via MCP. Follow these steps:

1. Call mcp__codex__codex with:
   - prompt: "Implement the following task. Tests are pre-written — make them pass.\n\nTask: {task}\n\nTest files:\n{test file contents}\n\nContext:\n{sanitized key file contents}"
   - sandbox: "workspace-write"
   - approval-policy: "on-failure"
   - developer-instructions: {content of codex-architect-role.md} + "\nTests are pre-written. Write minimal implementation to pass all tests. Do not modify test files."

2. Save the returned threadId.

3. Run the task's tests to verify GREEN.

4. If tests fail: call mcp__codex__codex-reply with the threadId and failure output. Retry up to 3 times.

5. Report back: files changed, final test result, any unresolved failures.
```

3. After each subagent: run `git diff $TASK_SHA` (scoped to this task only) to verify what changed, run the task's tests to confirm GREEN

**Important**: Each subagent owns its own Codex `threadId`. There is no shared threadId across tasks. Step B4 (code review) therefore uses the `code-reviewer` Task agent — not `mcp__codex__codex-reply` — since there is no single session to reply to.

**If plan has fewer than 3 tasks**, call `mcp__codex__codex` directly (iteration 1) or `mcp__codex__codex-reply` (iterations 2-3):
- prompt: "Implement the following task. Tests have already been written — your implementation must make all tests pass.\n\nTask: {task}\n\nTest files:\n{test file contents}\n\nContext:\n{sanitized key file contents}"
- prompt (retry): "Fix the following issues:\n\n{failure output or reviewer feedback verbatim}"
- sandbox: "workspace-write"
- approval-policy: "on-failure"
- developer-instructions: {content of codex-architect-role.md} + "\nTests are pre-written. Write minimal implementation to pass all tests. Do not modify test files."

Save the returned `threadId`. Reuse for all subsequent calls.

**Step B2 — Run Tests**

Run new tests to verify GREEN. Run baseline test scope to verify no new regressions.
If failures: include failure output verbatim in the next Codex iteration prompt.

**Step B3 — Coverage Check and Test Corrections (Claude owns)**

Check coverage if tooling is available (target 80%+). If unavailable, skip and note in delivery.

**Claude owns all post-RED test changes.** Codex never modifies test files. If additional tests are needed or existing tests need correction:
- Add coverage tests: write new test cases using Edit/Write, run to verify RED, then verify Codex's implementation passes them
- Correct bad tests: revise with explicit justification using Edit/Write, re-verify RED, then re-verify GREEN
- After any test changes: re-run the full new test suite to confirm GREEN before proceeding

**Step B4 — Code Review (Claude)**

Run `git add -N .` to mark any new untracked files as intent-to-add (ensures `git diff $START_SHA` includes new files).

Launch Task agent (subagent_type: "feature-dev:code-reviewer") with:
- `git diff $START_SHA` output
- Original task requirements

Parse reviewer response:
- No CRITICAL/HIGH → collect MEDIUM/LOW, ask user (same prompt as Route A step 10), then Phase 5

**Critical Evaluation** (before fixing): Critically evaluate each CRITICAL/HIGH finding:
- **Assess correctness**: Is it technically accurate? Check actual code and project conventions.
- **Check context**: Does the reviewer have full context, or is it flagging intentional design?
- **Verify applicability**: Does it improve correctness/security, or is it a style preference / false positive?
- **If a finding seems incorrect**: Do NOT fix it or count it as an iteration. Launch a new code-reviewer agent with the original diff, the contested findings, and your technical reasoning. Ask it to re-evaluate only the contested items. Accept confirmed findings; drop withdrawn ones. Discussion rounds do NOT count toward the iteration cap.

After evaluation:
- Has CRITICAL/HIGH (3+ task path) → dispatch a Claude subagent per affected task with the accepted reviewer feedback verbatim; there is no shared `threadId` to reply to, so do not call `mcp__codex__codex-reply`. After fixes, re-run `code-reviewer` (max 3 total iterations).
- Has CRITICAL/HIGH (single Codex session path) → call `mcp__codex__codex-reply` with accepted reviewer feedback verbatim, increment iteration (max 3 total iterations).

After 3 iterations without approval, stop and report remaining issues to user.
